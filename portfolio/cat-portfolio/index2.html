              This is my wonderful cat named Binx. He is 2 years old. He was resuced from Almost Home Adoptions in Westminster Colorado in July of 2019. Hopefully soon Binx will have another friend adopted from the same shelter. You can find out more about where Binx is from by visiting their website:

             Binx is extrememly playful and he loves to cuddle. During the day he can be found sleeping on his tall cat tower by the window. It is one of his favorite spots because there is  plenty of sunshine. He also loves catnip and loves getting plenty of treats!
